-1:59:59,810 --> 00:00:02,661
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,333
Please don't shut me out again.

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,569
Please don't slam the door

00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,649
You don't have to keep your distance anymore

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,660
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,849
I finally understand

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,209
For the first time in forever

00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,489
We can fix this hand in hand

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,658
We can head down this mountain together.

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,689
You don't have to live in fear

00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,611
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,969
I will be right here

00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,249
<i>Anna.</i>

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,169
<i>Please go back home</i>

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,940
<i>Your life awaits</i>

00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,289
<i>Go enjoy the sun, and open up the gates</i>

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,400
Yeah, but...

00:00:44,20 --> 00:00:44,769
<i>I know.</i>

00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>You mean well, but leave me be</i>

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,609
<i>Yes, I'm alone</i>

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,569
<i>But I'm alone and free</i>

00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,332
<i>Just stay away and you'll be safe from me</i>

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,571
Actually, we're not

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>What do you mean, you're not?</i>

00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,500
I get the feeling you don't know

00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,731
<i>What do I not know?</i>

00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,449
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,732
deep snow

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,091
<i>What?</i>

00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,052
You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere.

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,409
<i>Everywhere?</i>

00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,329
Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,578
<i>No, I can't. I don't know how.</i>

00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,131
Sure you can. I know you can.

00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,451
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,569
<i>Oh, I'm such a fool! I can't be free!</i>

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,000
You don't have to be afraid

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,889
<i>No escape from the storm inside of me</i>

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,889
We can work this out together

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,869
<i>I can't control the curse!</i>

00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,689
We'll reverse the storm you've made

00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,269
<i>Anna, please you'll only make it worse!</i>

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,069
Don't panic!

00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,369
<i>There's so much fear!</i>

00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,969
We'll make the sun shine bright

00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,369
<i>You're not safe here!</i>

00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,169
We can face this thing together

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,169
<i>No!</i>

00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,329
We can change this winter weather

00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,818
And everything will be all right

00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,811
<i>I can't!</i>
