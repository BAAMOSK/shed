00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know if You can hear me

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,000
Or if You're even there

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know if You would listen

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,000
To a gypsy's prayer

00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, I know I'm just an outcast

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,000
I shouldn't speak to you

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,000
Still I see Your face and wonder

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,000
Were You once an outcast too?

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
God help the outcasts

00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,000
Hungry from birth

00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,000
Show them the mercy

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,000
They don't find on Earth

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,000
God help my people

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,000
We look to you still

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,000
God help the outcasts

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,000
Or nobody will

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I ask for wealth,

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,000
I ask for fame

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,000
I ask for glory to shine on my name

00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,000
I ask for love,

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,000
I can possess

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:50,000
I ask for God and His angels to bless me

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,000
I ask for nothing

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,000
I can get by

00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,000
But I know so many

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,000
Less lucky than I

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,000
Please help my people

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,000
The poor and downtrod

00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,000
I thought we all were

00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,000
The children of God

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,000
God help the outcasts

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:38,000
Children of God
