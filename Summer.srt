-1:59:49,440 --> -1:59:50,999
Summer?

-1:59:51,000 --> -1:59:52,319
Oh. I don't know why,

-1:59:52,320 --> -1:59:56,079
but I've always loved the idea of summer

-1:59:56,080 --> -1:59:59,679
and sun, and all things hot.

-1:59:59,680 --> 00:00:00,759
Really?

00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,319
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.

00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,601
Nope.

00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,239
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,286
and imagine what it would be like when summer does come.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,599
Bees will buzz, kids will blow dandelion fuzz

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,567
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,319
A drink in my hand

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,719
My snow up against the burning sand

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,999
Probably getting gorgeously tanned

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,770
In summer.

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,359
I'll finally see a summer breeze

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,479
Blow away a winter storm

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,759
And find out what happens to solid water

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,691
When it gets warm

00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,479
And I can't wait to see

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,523
What my buddies all think of me

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,279
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,687
In summer!

00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,159
The hot and the cold are both so intense

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,727
Put them together It just makes sense

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,159
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle

00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,703
But put me in summer and I'll be a...

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
<i>(puddle?)</i>

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,079
Happy snowman!

00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,359
When life gets rough

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,881
I like to hold on to my dream

00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,887
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just letting off steam

00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,765
Oh, the sky will be blue

00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,204
And you guys will be there, too

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,159
When I finally do

00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,648
What frozen things do in summer!

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,364
I'm gonna tell him.

00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,364
Don't you dare.

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,167
In summer!
