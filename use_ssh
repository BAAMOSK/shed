# Run this to convert a GitHub repo from https to ssh.
# You'll need an SSH key. Most likely, you can find one with this:
# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copy and paste the entire contents of this file to your GitHub
# settings page: https://github.com/settings/keys
# You will then be able to pull and push without a password.

sed -i 's_https://github.com/_git@github.com:_' .git/config
git remote -v
