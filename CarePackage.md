Australian foods
================

In this box, you will find a variety of iconic Australian food items, curated
with love by... oh, who am I kidding. I just grabbed some supermarket basics
that you probably can't easily find in North America. :) Herein is an
explanation of what's included and why.


Biscuits
--------

* First and foremost, **chocolate ripple biscuits**, so you can give us a genuine
comparison of these against the chocolate Graham crackers. Choc Ripple Biscuits
can be eaten straight, dunked into a beverage, or of course made into the
[Chocolate Ripple Cake](ChocRippleCake) that takes its name from them.

* **Anzac biscuits** are named for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps
(ANZAC), and they happen to be rather delicious and travel well, so they had
to be included. Interestingly, the name is legally protected, and they must
never be sold as "Anzac cookies". (The more you know...)


Vegemite
--------

* I couldn't put a box like this together without including a little jar of
**Vegemite**. Don't overdo it; use it sparingly. Take a cracker or a slice of
bread, butter it, and then add just a little bit of Vegemite, and you'll get
an idea of what this iconically rough-tasting food is all about.


Chocolate
---------

Given who's sending you this box, the presence of chocolate is hardly going to
be surprising. Most of what I'm including is made by Cadbury, a British company
that for some reason isn't allowed to sell in the US. You might have access to
some or all of this, but hey. It's chocolate. More is better. Right?

* **Fry's Turkish Delight** is a very old brand that got bought out by Cadbury ages
ago, but was so well-known and loved that they've kept the branding ever since.

* **Cadbury Roses** could be considered Valentine's Day fare, but frankly, I'll eat
them any day of the year. They're an assortment of chocolates, and the exact
distribution has been the subject of some oh-so-scientific research by some
dude who [blogged about it](http://rosuav.blogspot.com/2012/06/scientific-research-into-cadbury-roses.html)
and even [got some international help](http://rosuav.blogspot.com/2013/02/scientific-research-iii-revenge-of.html).

* Another variety pack is the "**Favourites**" collection. Great for passing around
a group of people, because you all get to pick out your favourite. I love the
honeycomb one ("Crunchie").

* **Maltesers** brag that you can't eat just one. I'll leave it to you to decide
whether that's a good thing or not.

* I didn't think **pineapple-flavoured chocolates** were particularly Antipodean,
but I'm told they are, so here they are. This is another brand that Cadbury
owns, but is famous enough to retain on the packaging.

* **Creme Eggs** are found in two basic sizes - I guess they correspond to pigeon
eggs and chook eggs. Oh right. "Chook" is our word for "chicken", specifically
the animal as opposed to the food. Creme Eggs don't taste like chicken though,
they taste like chocolate. Naturally.

* Ever desperately wanted to put cherries, coconut, and chocolate together? Me
neither, but that's what makes a **Cherry Ripe** bar. I'm also running out of
imaginative things to say about these things, so just get to eating them and
find out for yourself!

* **Jaffas** have a crisp orange-flavoured outer shell and a chocolate interior.
There are some traditions associated with them, including rolling them down the
aisles in theatres, which I beg you not to do if you ever want to go back to
that theatre.


Other
-----

It may surprise you to learn that I eat some things that aren't chocolate.

* **Macadamia nuts** are native to Australia, though they're also grown in other
countries too now. You can get them straight or chocolate-covered.

* **Lamingtons** were invented by a British aristocratic lady who found that the
harsh weather of Australia made cake go stale very quickly. It's covered in a
sealing layer of chocolate icing, and then doused in coconut so you can pick
it up.

* Hakuna matata? Australian food is often called "grub", and it's not unknown
to eat actual **witchetty grubs** (look 'em up on Wikipedia: slimy yet satisfying);
but I'd much rather eat this version of them.


Honourable Mentions
-------------------

Not every Australian icon could be included. Here's a few other foods we eat;
if you ever come visit, ask for 'em!

* **Kangaroo**. Usually in steak or minced, roo meat can be substituted for beef
in pretty much anything, and it's always an improvement (in my totally unbiased
opinion). Available in supermarkets at a very reasonable price.

* **Emu**. Not as prevalent as roo, but still available. We eat both of the animals
on our coat of arms; no other country has such practical supporters!

* **Meat pies** are available in every bakery or hot bread shop across the country.
You can get famous brands like Four'n'Twenty, or individually-produced ones at
each bakery (and many buy from local butchers, too, making for a strong sense
of community). While it IS possible to get a bad one occasionally, the odds are
definitely in your favour.

* **Dim Sims**. No, I don't mean dim sum; the dim sim is peculiarly Australian and
only *inspired by* Chinese cuisine. Can be eaten fried or steamed. Has too many
vegetables and not enough chocolate for my liking, though.

* **Prawns**. Mmmmmmm, prawns. You probably have 'em too, but you call 'em "shrimp"
and they're not as prevalent.

So there you have it: a whirlwind tour of Australian cuisine, with a focus on
Rosuav-friendly food items. Enjoy!
