Watch git repositories for uncommitted or unpushed changes

TODO:

* Scan file system for .git directories

* Explicit list of directories to monitor

* In each directory, run 'git status' in porcelain mode

* Must show branch upstream status - if no associated remote, flag it

* Ideally email on fail

* Install into systemd incl .timer
