00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,011
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,616
<i>I love crazy.</i>

00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,499
All my life has been a series of doors in my face

00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,449
And then suddenly I bump into you

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,809
<i>I was thinking the same thing, because, like...</i>

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,059
<i>I've been searching my whole life to find my own place</i>

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,809
<i>And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue</i>

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,929
But with you

00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,569
<i>But with you I found my place</i>

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,889
I see your face

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,889
And it's nothing like I've ever known before

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,259
Love is an open door!

00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,889
Love is an open door!

00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,569
Love is an open door

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,329
With you

00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,295
Love is an open door

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,009
<i>I mean, it's crazy</i>

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,309
What?

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,372
<i>We finish each other's</i>

00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,872
Sandwiches

00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,609
<i>That's what I was gonna say!</i>

00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,809
I've never met someone

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,929
Who thinks so much like me

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,409
Jinx! Jinx again!

00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,109
Our mental synchronization

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,059
Can have but one explanation

00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,300
You and I were just meant to be

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,809
Say goodbye

00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,854
To the pain of the past

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,499
We don't have to feel it anymore

00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,696
Love is an open door

00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,049
Love is an open door!

00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,169
Life can be so much more

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,169
With you

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,529
Love is an open

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,212
Door

00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,499
<i>Can I say something crazy?</i>

00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,494
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,694
Can I say something even crazier?

00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,251
Yes!
