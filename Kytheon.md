Random notes on the Kytheon build
=================================

Brand new server to become the new Gideon. He's still young, though, so he goes
by the name Kytheon.

Hosting options:
* In-house: expensive internet, easy administration, our ping LAN, other ping SOHO
* Australia: expensive internet, adequate admin, our ping domestic, other ping OK
* Europe: cheap internet, laggy admin, our ping int'l, other ping int'l
* America: cheap internet, laggy admin, our ping int'l, other ping int'l or low

Desired use-cases include access from us, from other Australians (eg G&S Soc), and
from general public (eg Minstrel Hall clients). Low ping for us is very good; low
ping for G&S Soc people is of minor importance (since the site itself is so slow);
low ping for Minstrel Hall people is of moderate importance (there aren't many,
and they're mostly happy with what they have, so any improvement is improvement).
