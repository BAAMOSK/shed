Chocolate Ripple Cake
=====================

Ingredients
-----------

* 300g Chocolate Ripple biscuits **
* 600mL thickened cream (for whipping)
* 1tsp vanilla essence
* Sugar ("some")
* 6-12 Lindor balls (to taste)
* Rectangular plate/dish to work on (about the size of the packet of biscuits)

Directions
----------

1. Collect ingredients. Read all the instructions and comprehend them.
2. Open the packet of chocolate biscuits. Find a broken one and eat it.
3. Taste a Lindor ball.
4. Whip the cream in a jug with plenty of room.
5. Add some sugar to the cream. If you have chocolate-flavoured sugar, use it.
6. Taste another Lindor ball.
7. Add a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream. Optional if you used chocolate sugar.
8. Lay down a coating of cream on the plate.
9. Take two biscuits and sandwich them together with cream.
10. Cream another biscuit and add it to the stack. Stand the stack on its edge on the plated cream.
11. Build up two rows of biscuits, separated by cream. Every surface must be creamed.
12. Taste a Lindor ball.
13. Lather cream over the chocolate biscuits, covering them completely.
14. Taste another Lindor ball, or two to be on the safe side.
15. Check the biscuits carefully for any spots that aren't covered in cream.
16. Taste a Lindor ball.
17. Put the whole kit and caboodle in the fridge.
18. Taste another Lindor ball, and give one to your sister too.
19. Refrigerate overnight (the food, not you).
20. Taste the remaining Lindor balls while you wait.
21. Once the cream has completely softened the biscuits, defrigerate.
22. Slice diagonally. The first (corner) slice is the cook's privilege.
23. Serve the slices two at a time (you can't serve just one), making a lovely striped cake.

** Note that the biscuits are important. If you can't get the actual Arnott's Chocolate Ripple biscuits (entirely likely, since Arnott's is an Australian company), see if you can find something similar. They have to be made of a chocolatey dough, not chocolate coated or chocolate chip - think Oreos minus the filling.

Can also be done with ginger biscuits. It won't be "chocolate" ripple cake that way, though. You might have to come up with a new name. I suggest "ginger ripple cake", but YMMV.
