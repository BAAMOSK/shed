The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Sjá snjóinn glitra á fjallinu í nótt
See the snow sparkle on the mountain tonight

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
Ekkert fótspor hér að sjá
No footprints here to see

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Eitt einsemdar konungsríki
A kingdom of isolation

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
Og ég virðist, drottningin
And I seem to be, the Queen

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Vindurinn gnauðar eins og ólgan inni í mér
The wind blows like the turbulence inside of me

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Gat ei byrgt það inni en ég reyndi samt
Couldn't keep it in, but I still tried

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Hleyp þeim ei inn lát þau ei sjá
Don't let them in, don't let them see

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Vertu góða stelpan sem þú varst
Be the good girl you always were

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Feldu, bældu, seg þeim ei frá
Hide, suppress, don't tell them

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
En þau vita það þá
But then they know

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Þetta er nóg, þetta er nóg
This is enough, this is enough

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Get ei lengur haldið í mér
Can't hold it in any more

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Þetta er nóg, þetta er nóg
This is enough, this is enough

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Ég sný burt og skelli á eftir mér
I turn away and slam the door

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Mig varðar ei Hvað þau segja við því
I don't care What they'll say about that

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Látið geysa storm
Let a storm rage on

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Því kuldinn hann hefur ei háð mér neitt
The cold hasn't bothered me anything

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Það er merkilegt hvað fjarlægð
It's interesting how distance

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
Gerir allt svo ofursmátt
Makes everything so small

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Og hræðslan sem hafði tökin
And the fear that once had the control

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
Virðist missa allan mátt
Seems to lose all its power

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Ég þarf að sjá hvað ég get gert
I have to see what I can do

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Og reyná verk mín umtalsvert
And experience my powers pretty much

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Og boð og bönn ei halda mér
And rules and bans don't hold me back

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Ég er frjáls
I'm free

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Þetta er nóg, þetta er nóg
This is enough, this is enough

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Uppi í himni eins og vindablær
To the sky like the wind goes

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Þetta er nóg, komið nóg
This is enough, enough

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Og tár mín enginn sér fær
And no one'll get my tears

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Hér ég stend Og hér ég verð
Here I stand And here I'll stay

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Látið geysa storm
Let a storm rage on

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Minn máttur þyrlast gegnum loftið niðrá jörð
My power swirls through the air down to the ground

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Mín sál er hringiða úr frosnum brotamyndum gjörð
My soul is upside down out of frozen fractals made

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Ein hugsun kristalla sem ískalt sprengigos
[One thought that icy crystals explosive]

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Ég aldrei aftur sný
I'm never going back

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Það var sem eitt sinn var
It was like it once was

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Þetta er nóg, þetta er nóg
This is enough, this is enough

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Og ég rís eins og morgunsól
I rise like the sun on dawn

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Þetta er nóg, þetta er nóg
This is enough, this is enough

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Þessi þæga stelpa fór
This pleasing girl is gone

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Hér ég stend Ein um bjartan dag
Here I stand Alone on a bright day

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Látið geysa storm
Let a storm rage on

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Kuldinn hann hefur ei háð mér neitt
The cold hasn't bothered me anything
