00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,036
Elsa?

00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,515
Do you wanna build a snowman?

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,317
Come on, let's go and play

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,273
I never see you any more

00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,716
Come out the door

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,476
It's like you've gone away

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,591
We used to be best buddies, and now we're not

00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,671
I wish you would tell me why

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,636
Do you wanna build a snowman?

00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,429
It doesn't have to be a snowman

00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,189
Go away, Anna.

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,200
Okay, bye

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,561
The gloves will help.

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,949
See? Conceal it.

00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,589
Don't feel it.

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,394
Don't let it show.

00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,109
Do you wanna build a snowman?

00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,429
Or ride our bike around the halls?

00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,629
I think some company is overdue

00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,669
I've started talking
To the pictures on the walls

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,749
Hang in there, Joan.

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,432
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms

00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,361
Just watching the hours tick by

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,629
I'm scared.

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,709
It's getting stronger!

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,549
Getting upset only makes it worse. Calm down.

00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,349
No! Don't touch me!

00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,678
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,354
See you in two weeks!

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,631
Do you have to go?

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,039
You'll be fine, Elsa.

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,995
Your Highness.

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,311
Elsa?

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,557
Please, I know you're in there

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,117
People are asking where you've been

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,999
They say "Have courage", and I'm trying to

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,269
I'm right out here for you

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,677
Just let me in

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,720
We only have each other; it's just you and me

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,241
What are we gonna do?

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,910
Do you wanna build a snowman?
