00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,413
It's Coronation Day!

00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,649
The window is open!

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,809
So's that door!

00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,129
I didn't know they did that any more

00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,380
Who knew we owned 8,000 salad plates?

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,212
For years I've roamed these empty halls

00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,812
Why have a ballroom with no balls?

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,215
Finally, they're opening up the gates!

00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,049
There'll be actual, real, live people

00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,049
It'll be totally strange

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,300
But wow! Am I so ready for this change!

00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,899
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,609
There'll be music, there'll be light

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,052
For the first time in forever

00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,098
I'll be dancing through the night

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,249
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy

00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,215
But I'm somewhere in that zone

00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,252
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,049
I won't be alone

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,060
I can't wait to meet everyone!

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,489
What if I meet The One?

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,569
Tonight, imagine me gown and all

00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,889
Fetchingly draped against the wall

00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,414
The picture of sophisticated grace

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,889
I suddenly see him standing there

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,209
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair

00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,889
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!

00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,609
But then we laugh and talk all evening

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,889
Which is totally bizarre

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,095
Nothing like the life I've led so far

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,455
For the first time in forever

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,133
There'll be magic, there'll be fun

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,614
For the first time in forever

00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,333
I could be noticed by someone

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,017
And I know it is totally crazy

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,651
To dream I'd find romance

00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,659
But for the first time in forever

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,737
At least I've got a chance!

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,219
Don't let them in

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,652
Don't let them see

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,180
Be the good girl you always have to be

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,501
Conceal, don't feel

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,693
Put on a show

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,141
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,969
But it's only for today

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,499
It's only for today

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,935
It's agony to wait

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,935
It's agony to wait

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,941
Tell the guards to open up

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,178
The gate

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,178
The gate

00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,849
For the first time in forever

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,659
Don't let them in, don't let them see

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,689
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,329
Be the good girl you always have to be

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,649
A chance to change my lonely world

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,649
Conceal

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,049
A chance to find true love

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,209
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,209
I know it all ends tomorrow

00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,220
So it has to be today!

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,218
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,612
For the first time in forever

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,575
Nothing's in my way!
